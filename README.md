# finsweet-site.github.io
This is a practice site for a vehicle repair company called Finsweet. 

This was an indivdual task which involved building and full nonfunctional webpage.
AT the moment, the site is non-functional and involves:

Pure HTML
CSS
BOOTSTRAP.

You could check out this site and if possible make some recommendations and critics just so i can 
become much better at building sites to perfection. THANK YOU.
